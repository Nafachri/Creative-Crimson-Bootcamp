            <p>Formula 1: Drive to Survive is a documentary series produced in collaboration between Netflix and Formula One to give an exclusive behind-the-scenes look at the drivers and races of the 2018 and 2019 Formula One World Championships.</p>
            <p>Season 1: 2018 World Championship
                The ten-part documentary series is the "first to truly immerse the audience inside the cockpits, the paddock and the lives of the key players in Formula 1". The series covers the 2018 Formula One World Championship and has "unparalleled and exclusive access to the world's fastest drivers, team principals and owners, as well as Formula 1's own management team".
            </p>
            <p>
                Season 2: 2019 World Championship
                The ten-part documentary series covers the 2019 Formula One World Championship and will include every team, including Ferrari and Mercedes who had not allowed Netflix to cover their teams in the first season. The second season will also "revisit Daniel Ricciardo at Renault, follow Pierre Gasly's emotional rollercoaster of a year, and cast a spotlight on the Belgian Grand Prix weekend, which was blackened by the death of Formula 2 driver Anthoine Hubert during a support race".
